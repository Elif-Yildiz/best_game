You have to ask him polietly or else you will get fired.

If you mail me I will give you the answer,
just kidding. xxpururinxx@gmail.com ;)
Like i said ask the vise man.
How does he look like?
He wears glasses, you will understand.
Don't forget he is ruler of the sky.
Go and ask him, don't be shy.
You can mention me as a reference ;)
HOWEVER do not say you found this writing or else you will be in trouble for cheating and I also will.
Never ever do that, if you do I will be your nightmare ^^

So how does it go?
You asked him right?
It is the fastest way to solution right?
See, I told you.
If it does not work, you were probably not polite enough. Just try again, but politer this time.

YOU THINK I AM SUS. WTF!
YOU ARE SUS, YOU COME HERE AND READ ALL MY STUFF AND COPY!
WHO IS SUS NOW? YOU.
This is the only solution you got and you can find, you better try it.
